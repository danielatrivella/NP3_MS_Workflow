$NP^3$ MS Workflow
A Pipeline for LC-MS/MS Metabolomics Data Process and Analysis 
The $NP^3$ Mass Spectrometry (MS) workflow is a program with a collection of scripts to enhance untargeted metabolomics research focused on drug discovery with optimizations towards natural products. 

This workflow proposes an automatized procedure with the capability to cluster (join) and quantify the MS2 spectra (MS/MS) associated with the same ion, which eluted in concurrent chromatographic peaks (MS1), of a collection of samples from LC-MS/MS experiments. It generates a rank of spectra candidates responsible for the observed hits in bioactivity experiments and suggests the real number of metabolites present in the samples. Molecular networks are created to improve the analysis and visualization of the results.
